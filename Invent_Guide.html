                    <p>Technology transfer is the transfer of knowledge and discoveries to the public.
                    It can occur through publications, educated students entering the workforce,
                    exchanges at conferences, and relationships with industry, among other things. For the purposes of this guide,                           technology transfer refers to the formal licensing of technology to third parties under the
                    guidance of professionals employed by universities, research foundations, and
                    businesses. For the purposes of this guide, technology transfer refers to the formal

                        <br>
                    <p>Technology is typically transferred through a license agreement in which the University grants its rights in the defined technology to a third party for a period of years, often limited to a particular field of use and/or region of the world. The licensee (the third party licensing the technology) may be an established company or a new business start-up. Licenses include terms that require the licensee to meet certain performance requirements and to make financial payments to the University. These payments are shared with the inventors and are also distributed to the schools/colleges, departments/ units, and central administration to provide support for further research, education, and participation in the Office of Technology Transfer process.</p>

                    <p>The U.S. Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 allows universities and other non-profit institutions to have ownership rights to discoveries resulting from federally funded research, provided certain obligations are met. These obligations include making efforts to protect (when appropriate) and commercialize the discoveries, submitting progress reports to the funding agency, giving preference to small businesses that demonstrate sufficient capability, and sharing any resulting revenues with the inventors. The Bayh-Dole Act is credited with stimulating interest in Office of Technology Transfer activities and generating increased research, commercialization, educational opportunities, and economic development in the United States.</p>

                        <p>•To avoid risking your patent rights and possibly hindering the opportunity to market your invention, contact FAMU Office of Technology Transfer before holding any discussions with people outside the Office of Technology Transfer community.</p>
                        <p>•To avoid losing your patent rights, contact FAMU Office of Technology Transfer before submitting grant applications to any outside public or private funding agencies.</p>
                
                <p>•On the FAMU Invention Disclosure Form, include companies and contacts you believe might be interested in your invention or who may have already contacted you about your invention. Studies have shown that over 70% of all licenses are executed with commercial entities known by the inventor, so your contacts can be extremely useful.</p>

                        <br>
                    <p>Yes, but since patent rights are affected by these activities, it is best to submit an Invention Disclosure (discussed in next section) well before communicating or disclosing your invention to people outside the Office of Technology Transfer community. There are significant differences between the U.S. and other countries as to how early publication affects a potential patent. Once publicly disclosed (published or presented in some form), an invention may have restricted or minimal potential for patent protection outside of the United States. Be sure to inform the licensing specialist assigned to you of any imminent or prior presentation, lecture, poster, abstract, website description, research proposal submission, dissertation/masters thesis, publication, or other public presentation including the invention.</p>

                        <br>
                    <p>Yes, but it is important to document carefully the date and conditions of use so that we can determine if this use may influence the ownership and license rights of your subsequent research results.

                    <p>Yes. However it is important to document items that are to be shared with others and the conditions of use. If you wish to send materials to an outside collaborator, an outgoing MTA should be completed for this purpose. It also may be necessary to have a Confidentiality Agreement completed to protect your research results or intellectual property. Contact FAMU Office of Technology Transfer representative at 850-412-7232 to assist you in completing outgoing MTAs or Confidentiality Agreements.</p>

                    <div id="research_info4" class="collapse">
                        <br>
                    <p>The Sponsored Research Agreement should specify the intellectual property (IP) rights of the sponsor. The University generally retains ownership of the patent rights and other intellectual property resulting from sponsored research. However, the sponsor may have rights to obtain a license to the defined and expected outcomes of the research. (continued on the next page) Research Considerations 7 (continued from the previous page) Often, sponsored research contracts allow the sponsor a limited time to negotiate a license for any patent or intellectual property rights developed as the result of the research. Even so, the sponsor generally will not have contractual rights to discoveries that are clearly outside of the scope of the research. Therefore, it is important to define the scope of work within a research agreement. Sponsored research projects are handled by Old Dominion University Research Foundation (Office of Technology Transfer). Project representatives from Office of Technology TransferRF work closely with FAMU Office of Technology Transfer on IP issues in sponsored research agreements. If you have questions about sponsored research, please contact the Office of Technology Transfer project representative responsible for the sponsor. For more information on the Office of Technology Transfer, call 850-412-7232.</p>

                    <p>When researchers enter into consulting agreements, they are deemed to be acting outside of the scope of their employment. 
					Therefore consulting arrangements are not negotiated by the University nor formally reviewed by FAMU Office of Technology Transfer or Office of Technology TransferRF. 
					Researchers who enter into consulting agreements should familiarize themselves with the policies of their school or college relevant to consulting activities. 
					The researcher is expected to ensure that the terms of the consulting arrangement are consistent with University policies, including those related to IP ownership, employment responsibilities and use of Intellectual Property. 
					FAMU Office of Technology Transfer is available to provide informal advice on how your consulting agreement relates to your FAMU’s Intellectual Property. A discussion regarding

										<p>In the U.S., a patent gives the holder the

											affirmative right to practice a technology
											since it may fall under a broader patent
											owned by others. Instead, it provides the
											right to exclude others from practicing
											the invention. Patent claims are the legal

						  <button data-toggle="collapse" class="btn btn-success" data-target="#patent_info7">More</button>

							<div id="patent_info7" class="collapse">
								<br>
									<p>Patent applications are generally drafted
										by a patent attorney or a patent
										agent (a non-attorney with a science
										education licensed to practice by the
										USPTO). The patent attorney generally will
										ask you to review an application before
										it is filed and will also ask you questions
										about inventorship of the application
										claims. At the time an application is filed,
										the patent attorney will ask the inventor(s)
										to sign an Inventor’s Declaration
										and an Assignment, which evidences the
										inventor’s duty to assign the patent to
										the University.
										In about one year or longer, depending
										on the technology, the patent attorney
										will receive written notice from the USPTO
										as to whether the application and its
										claims have been accepted in the form
										as filed. More often than not, the USPTO
										rejects the application because either
										certain formalities need to be cleared
										up, or the claims are not patentable over
										the “prior art” (anything that workers in
										the field have made or publicly disclosed
										in the past). The letter sent by the USPTO
										is referred to as an Office Action or Official
										Action.</p>
													<p>
													If the application is rejected, the patent
													attorney must file a written response,
													usually within three to six months. Generally
													the attorney may amend the claims
													and/or point out why the USPTO’s position
													is incorrect. This procedure is referred
													to as patent prosecution. Often it will
													take two USPTO Official Actions and two
													responses by the patent attorney—and
													sometimes more—before the application
													is resolved. The resolution can take the
													form of a USPTO notice that the application
													is allowable; in other words, the
													USPTO agrees to issue a patent. During
													this process, input from the inventor(s) is
													often needed to confirm patent attorney’s
													understanding of the technical aspects
													of invention and/or prior arts cited
													against the application. The USPTO holds
													patent applications confidential until
													published by the USPTO, 18 months after
													initial filing.</p>

									A regular U.S. application and related foreign applications must be filed within

							<div id="patent_info11" class="collapse">
								<br>
									<p>Although an international patent does
										not exist, an international agreement
										known as the Patent Cooperation Treaty
										(PCT) provides a streamlined filing procedure
										for most industrialized nations.
										For U.S. applicants, a PCT application is
										generally filed one year after the corresponding
										U.S. application (either provisional
										or regular) has been submitted.
										The PCT application must later be filed
										in the national patent office of any country
										in which the applicant wishes to seek
										patent protection, generally within 30
										months of the earliest claimed filing date.
										The PCT provides two advantages:
										First, it delays the need to file costly
										foreign applications until the 30-month
										date, often after an applicant has the
										opportunity to further develop, evaluate
										and/or market the invention for licensing.
										Second, the international preliminary
										examination often allows an applicant to
										simplify the patent prosecution process
										by having a single examiner speak to the
										patentability of the claims, which can
										save significant costs in prosecuting foreign
										patent applications. </p>
																<p>An important international treaty called
																the Paris Convention permits a patent
																application filed in a second country (or
																a PCT application) to claim the benefit
																of the filing date of an application filed in
																a first country. However, pursuant to this
																treaty, these so-called “convention applications”
																must be filed in foreign countries
																(or as a PCT) within one year of the first
																filing date of the U.S. application.</p>

									<p>Trademark registration is a procedure in which the United States Patent and Trademark
											Office (USPTO) provides a determination of rights based upon legitimate use

											prevent others from infringing upon the trademark. Trademarks generally become
											protected as soon as they are adopted by an organization and used in commerce,
											even before registration. With a federal trademark registration, the registrant is presumed
											to be entitled to use the trademark throughout the United States for the

								a start-up company is an alternative
								to licensing the IP to an established business.
								Standard requirements in a license
								for an Office of Technology Transfer startup include minor financial
								terms, such as a royalty on product
								sales (depending on exclusivity of
								license), reimbursement of patent costs,
								a dilutable equity, and a small non-dilutable
								equity upon a liquidity event. Licensing
								for a faculty startup also include

							<p>Office of Technology Transfer faculty typically serve as technology
									consultants, advisors or in some other
									technical developmental capacity.
									Rarely do faculty choose to leave the
									University and join the start-up. In many
									cases, the faculty role is suggested by
									the start-up investors and management
									team who identify the best role based
									on the inventor’s expertise and interests.
									As the company matures, and additional

								enters into NDAs for University proprietary information shared with someone
								outside of the University. Office of Technology TransferRF manages incoming NDAs related to research
								contracts.</p>

							<p>• Material Transfer Agreements (MTAs), used for incoming and outgoing materials
								at the University, are administered by FAMU Office of Technology Transfer (outgoing
								materials) or Office of Technology TransferRF (incoming materials). These agreements describe the terms under
								which University researchers and outside researchers may share materials, typically

Another example is when conducting research at Office of Technology Transfer could affect faculty’s personal wealth. Therefore, research funding for work in faculty’s lab from a startup in which faculty owns equity is not allowed. In addition, federally funded research projects in collaboration with faculty’s startup are generally not allowed except with Phase I SBIR’s and STTR’s funding. However, employees of faculty’s startup should not be involved in research activities in faculty’s lab. Moreover, purchases from faculty’s startup should be comprehensively reviewed with head of faculty department. Last, faculty’s startup cannot restrict or delay access to results from Office of Technology Transfer research. This rule applies to any entities with direct financial link to a faculty’s start-up.</p>
